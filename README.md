<h1>Retro Gaming Website</h1>

<p>Games Revisited is a blog site that I have been contributing to part-time for several years, and in it's current state uses a basic wordpress template. The general
idea behind the site is to create as much community engagement as possible, something that is lacking in it's current form due to it's relatively
clunky interface.</p> <p>It is my hope that by creating a sleeker look and more user friendly navigation; it could potentially become something of a
hub style website containing a forum - allowing for greater engagement between the sites users and content creators, as well as acting as a hosting site for
aspiring game journalists, where they can point to a portfolio of their own published writing.</p> <p>Games Revisited is very much a niche site, so there is something of a focus
on lists and features in order to make the information easily digestible for anyone unfamiliar with the concept.</p>

<h2>UX</h2>

<p>The main goal of Games Revisited is to create a regualr userbase. As such, emphasis has been placed on contact pages;
as well as offering users the chance to submit their own writing. Social links have been included for the site, as well as for the writers 
themselves. </p>

<ul>
<li>As an aspiring writer, I want to be able to discuss other people's work and submit work of my own in order to kickstart my portfolio</li>
<li>As a retro game enthusiast, I want to be able to see a variety of games from different years and platforms, so that I can ascertain the level of knowledge posessed by the site's writers </li>
<li>As somebody new to retro gaming, I want to be able to learn as much as possible as quickly as I can, so that I can get started playing the best retro games possible.</li>
<li>As a casual gamer, I'm looking to reminisce about games I've played in my childhood and suggest other titles for writers to review.</li>
<li>As a hardcore gamer, I'm looking to find niche content that I wont find anywhere else so that I can better understand different franchises</li>
</ul>
