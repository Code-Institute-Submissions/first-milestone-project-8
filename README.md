<h1>Retro Gaming Website</h1>

<p>Games Revisited is a blog site that I have been contributing to part-time for several years, and in it's current state uses a basic wordpress template. The general
idea behind the site is to create as much community engagement as possible, something that is lacking in it's current form due to it's relatively
clunky interface.</p> <p>It is my hope that by creating a sleeker look and more user friendly navigation; it could potentially become something of a
hub style website containing a forum - allowing for greater engagement between the sites users and content creators, as well as acting as a hosting site for
aspiring game journalists, where they can point to a portfolio of their own published writing.</p> <p>Games revisited is very much a niche site, so there is something of a focus
on lists and features in order to make the information easily digestible for anyone unfamiliar with the concept</p>
