<h1>Retro Gaming Website</h1>

<p>Games Revisited is a blog site that I have been contributing to part-time for several years, and in it's current state uses a basic wordpress template. The general
idea behind the site is to create as much community engagement as possible, something that is lacking in it's current form due to it's relatively
clunky interface.</p> <p>It is my hope that by creating a sleeker look and more user friendly navigation; it could potentially become something of a
hub style website containing a forum - allowing for greater engagement between the sites users and content creators, as well as acting as a hosting site for
aspiring game journalists, where they can point to a portfolio of their own published writing.</p> <p>Games Revisited is very much a niche site, so there is something of a focus
on lists and features in order to make the information easily digestible for anyone unfamiliar with the concept.</p>

<h2>UX</h2>

<p>The main goal of Games Revisited is to create a regular userbase. As such, emphasis has been placed on contact pages;
as well as offering users the chance to submit their own writing. Social links have been included for the site, as well as for the writers 
themselves. </p>

<ul>
<li>As an aspiring writer, I want to be able to discuss other people's work and submit work of my own in order to kickstart my portfolio</li>
<li>As a retro game enthusiast, I want to be able to see a variety of games from different years and platforms, so that I can ascertain the level of knowledge posessed by the site's writers </li>
<li>As somebody new to retro gaming, I want to be able to learn as much as possible as quickly as I can, so that I can get started playing the best retro games possible.</li>
<li>As a casual gamer, I'm looking to reminisce about games I've played in my childhood and suggest other titles for writers to review.</li>
<li>As an avid gamer, I'm looking to find niche content that I wont find anywhere else so that I can better understand different franchises</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Existing Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>Feature 1 - The Welcome page <p>The user is welcomed to the page by a hero image taking up the entire background (aside from the nav), with the name of the site and it's slogan in the centre. The goals of the site are summed up
in a grid of cards under the hero image, each featuring a FontAwesome glyphicon</p></li>
<li>Feature 2 - The Hall of Fame page <p>A table that allows users to quickly digest bite-sized chunks of information in order to better understand what we find exemplary in retro gaming.
The table also includes hyperlinks to youtube in the first column to show either a commerical or a playthrough of a game so the user can better understand without having to read any content. At the bottom
of the page are two buttons, designed to be a quick jumping point from the Hall Of Fame to the Hall Of Shame page, as well as a quick link to the contact page should any users wish to get in touch with the site.</p></li>
<li>Feature 2 - The Hall Of Shame page <p>Another table, similar to the HOF page, but done with a sense of humour. Includes a hyperlinked contact button at the bottom of the table in order
to try and start a dialogue with anyone who may disagree with the opinions presented, as well as another button linking back to the Hall Of Fame page to create some synergy between the content.</li>
<li>Feature 4 - The Fallout Map Page <p>This page contains some of the more niche content for people who consider gaming to be their primary hobby, in particular fans of the Fallout franchise.
The images have been neatly displayed within a carousel including text boxes on the images. This provides some interactivity for those interested, as well as being condensed enough that the content
will not intrude to anyone who isn't interested.</p></li>
<li>Feature 5 - The About Page <p>Cards displaying information and social links for everyone who writes for the site, allowing users to contact writers personally</li>
