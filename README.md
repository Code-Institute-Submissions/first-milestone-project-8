First Milestone Project

For my first attempt at independent web design, I chose to adapt a site called Games Revisited. Games Revisited is a blog site
that I have been contributing to part-time for several years, and in it's current state uses a basic wordpress template. The general
idea behind the site is to create as much community engagement as possible, something that is lacking in it's current form due to it's relatively
clunky interface. It is my hope that by creating a sleeker look and more user friendly navigation; it could potentially become something of a
hub style website - allowing for greater engagement between the sites users and content creators, as well as acting as a hosting site for
aspiring game journalists, where they can point to a portfolio of their own published writing.
